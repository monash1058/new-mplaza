      below.

      information relating to your purchases, to provide you with other
      information that we think may be of interest to you, and for other

    <p>
      Mplaza automatically collects your browser type and browser software
      version to tailor the presentation of the services to your platform and
      to maintain a record of your activity on the site. To improve our site
      and make it more useful and interesting to you, we use “cookies” for

      present to you. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored
      by your browser on your computer hard drive and enable users to specify
      unique preferences and to track user trends and patterns. As an
      automatic process, our web server software records a log file of IP
      addresses that access the site. We also collect IP address information
      but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to users&#39; personal
      information. However, will use IP addresses to identify a user when we,
      in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce
      compliance with our various policies or to protect our services, site,
      customers or others.

    <strong>
      Third-Party Advertiser Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
    </strong>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some advertisements on our site are served by third-party advertisers,
      ad networks and ad servers. These third parties may use cookies alone or
      in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to
      collect information about our users. This may include information about
      your behavior on this and other sites to serve you advertisements that
      may be of interest to you. We do not control these third parties&#39;
      tracking technologies or how they may be used. For information about how
      you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers,
      please see the Opt-Out Policy section of this Privacy Statement above.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>Sharing Your Information</strong>
    <br />
    <p>
      We may use personal information about you for our own internal purposes,
      including, but not limited to, contacting you via email to inform you
      about updates to our services, providing you with information relating
      to your purchases from us, and providing you with other information that
      we think may be of interest to you. Mplaza enters into co-branding
      relationships with third-party websites and companies to provide
      products and services to our customers. If you are an Mplaza customer,
      Mplaza may share your personal information with certain co- branded
      third-party service or product providers as required to provide a
      specific product or service that you request from a co-branded page or
      co-branded site. However, these third-party partners are obligated not
      to use this personal information for any reason other than to provide
      the service or product that you have explicitly signed up for. If you
      join Mplaza through a co-branded site (e.g., on a co-branded
      registration page), it is Mplaza general policy not to share anything
      other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner; however, any
      personal information you provide may also be received by the co-branded
      site and could be stored and used by the co-branded service or product
      provider according to their privacy policy. We strongly encourage you to
      take the time to review these third-party privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we may provide summary statistics about our customers’
      interests and preferences, products sold, traffic patterns and related
      site information to third parties. These statistics do not include
      personal information; they are used only to enhance the design of our
      site and customize new products offerings to our customers. We do not
      use or share personal information provided to us online in ways
      unrelated to the ones described in this Privacy Statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve user privacy,
      we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, when
      requested in connection with a governmental investigation or under
      similar circumstances wherein we have a good-faith belief that such
      action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a
      governmental investigation or directive, court order or legal process.
      We may also disclose personal information to enforce or apply our
      Service Terms and Conditions and other agreements, including for billing
      and collection purposes, and if we believe disclosure is necessary or
      appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mplaza, our
      customers or others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we may disclose personal information that we collect or
      you provide to us to a buyer or other successor in the event of a change
      in ownership, merger or sale or transfer of some or all of Mplaza assets
      in which personal information held by Mplaza about our users is among
      the assets transferred. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to
      notify you (for example, by posting on our site) of any such change in
      ownership, merger or acquisition of Mplaza’s assets.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>Preventing Unauthorized Access to Your Information</strong>
    <br />
    <p>
      When appropriate, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server software to
      help prevent unauthorized access to the information you submit online.
      If and when you place orders or access your account information, SSL
      technology encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.
      You can identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will
      begin with “https:” (instead of “http:”). Please note that although we
      have implemented measures designed to help protect your personal
      information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data as it travels
      over the Internet.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>Accessing and Updating Your Information</strong>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you register for an account with us, you can review the personal
      information you provided Mplaza and update such information by accessing
      your account. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy
      of the information which you originally provided to us in our archives
      for uses documented herein. If you have questions regarding your ability
      to update or remove information, or relating to this Privacy Statement,
      you may email us at CustomerService@Mplaza.finance.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>Use of Your Personal Information Following Termination</strong>
    <br />
    <p>
      We save your personal information until your account with us is
      terminated or your use of the site is otherwise discontinued, or the
      service package(s) you purchase has expired, whichever is later. To
      terminate membership, contact Mplaza Customer Service at
      CustomerService@Mplaza.finance. If you terminate your membership, your
      personal information cannot be recovered; however, you may continue to
      receive email communications for a short period of time until we have
      updated all of our databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, your personal information will remain on
      our archived database and records. We will not use this archived
      personal information except to the extent we believe it may be necessary
      to prevent fraud or future abuse, or if required by law. In addition to
      the above, we will maintain information on users who have been removed
      for violating any of our agreements. If you have any questions about
      this Privacy Statement or the practices of this site, you may contact us
      by using the Contact Us section of the site.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>Changes to Our Privacy Statement</strong>
    <br />
    <p>
      By using our site, you consent to the collection and use of the above
      information by us. If we decide to change our Privacy Statement, we will

      what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances
      we disclose this information. Unless otherwise provided below, the
      revised terms will take effect when they are posted. Once any changes
      that we make to this Privacy Statement become effective, your continued
      use of the site after such time will signify your acceptance of the new
